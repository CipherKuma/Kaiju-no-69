<div align="center">
  <h3>🏆 ShapeCraft 2 Hackathon Submission - AI x NFT 🏆</h3>
  <p><strong>Transform Trading Algorithms into Living NFTs</strong></p>
  <p>Where Expert Traders Become Kaijus and Followers Become Shadows</p>
</div>

## 🎯 Project Vision

**Kaiju No. 69** reimagines algorithmic trading through the lens of NFTs. Expert traders deploy their AI trading algorithms as **Kaiju NFTs** - powerful creatures that live on-chain. Retail traders can harness this power by minting **Shadow NFTs**, which automatically mirror every trade their chosen Kaiju makes.

### 🎪 The Magic: Core Components
- **Trading Algorithms** → **Living Kaiju NFTs** (Free Mint to the Kaiju Owner)
- **Copy Trading Access** → **Shadow NFTs** (Paid Mint for Regular Users)
- **Dynamic NFT Art** → Changes form based on the shadows strength (ERC7160 Standard)
- **30-Day Lifecycle** → Shadows expire, maintaining ecosystem balance. Users need to mint Shadow NFT again.

## 🌟 Key Innovation: NFT-Based Copy Trading

### For Expert Traders (Kaiju Creators)
1. **Deploy** your trading algorithm following our standards
2. **Mint** your Kaiju NFT for free - it's your algorithm's on-chain identity and proof of ownership.
3. **Earn** commission from every Shadow NFT minted and every profitable trade

### For Followers (Shadow Holders)
1. **Browse** Kaiju performance metrics (Win Rate, PnL%, Trade History)
2. **Mint** a Shadow NFT by paying the mint fee
3. **Automatically** copy all trades from your chosen Kaiju
4. **Track** your Shadow's performance as its appearance evolves

## 🎨 NFT Mechanics

### 🐲 Kaiju NFTs (Expert Traders)
- **Free Mint** for algorithm creators
- **Unique Identity** for each trading algorithm
- **Performance Tracking** on-chain
- **Commission Earnings** from Shadows

### 👤 Shadow NFTs (Followers)
- **Paid Mint** with customizable fee set by Kaiju owner
- **30-Day Lifespan** - expires and needs re-minting
- **Dynamic Appearance** - changes based on performance (powered by ERC7160)
- **Tradeable** on OpenSea until expiration
- **Automatic Trade Copying** - all Kaiju trades executed for Shadow holders

## 🔄 How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Trading Algorithm] -->|Posts Signal| B[Kaiju Service]
    B -->|Finds Shadows| C[Shadow NFT Holders]
    B -->|Executes Trades| D[DeFi Protocols]
    D -->|Returns Results| E[Update Performance]
    E -->|Changes Appearance| F[Dynamic NFT Art]
```

1. **Expert creates trading algorithm** following our guide
2. **Algorithm signals profitable trades** to Kaiju Service
3. **Service executes trades** for all Shadow holders
4. **Performance updates** reflected in NFT metadata
5. **Shadow appearance evolves** based on success

## 💰 Economic Model

### Revenue Streams
- **Mint Fees**: Shadow holders pay to mint (set by Kaiju owner)
- **Performance Commission**: % of profits from successful trades
- **Recurring Revenue**: Shadows expire every 30 days

### Example Economics
- Shadow Mint Fee: 10 SHAPE tokens
- Performance Commission: 20% of profits
- If Kaiju has 100 Shadows: 1000 SHAPE/month base revenue
- Plus 20% of all profitable trades
